    <h2>Question and Answer Segment</h2>

   <h3>Question</h3>  
    Write five points on advantages and disadvantages of the nuclear family?
    
    
    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <h3>Answer:</h3>
    
    A nuclear family, in small terms, comprises husband, wife, and their unmarried
    <br> children. The children leave the parental home after the wedding and build 
    <br> their own independent house. A nuclear family is also an independent entity,
    <br> free from the influence of the elders. 
    <br>There is a reduced connection between parents and their married children.
    
    <h3>Advantages of Nuclear family</h3>
   <h4> 1. Possibility of Reduced Conflicts </h4>
    
    Conflicts are bound to exist in any family and home, it is part and parcel of life, however there is a possibility of reduced conflicts as the number of people are lesser in nuclear family compared to joint family.
    As the number of people are less in a nuclear family, the expenditures could come down.
    
   <h4>2. Personal Responsibilities </h4>
    
    There is no transfer of responsibility in the nuclear family like there is in the joint family.
    Parents are obliged to accept responsibility of their children on their own.
    In order to provide for his family, the head of the family needs to work hard.
    <h4>3. Harmony and peace</h4>
    
    For a pleasant family relationship, peace and prosperity are extremely important.
    Misunderstandings are bound to exist in any family, however, as the number of members are fewer in a nuclear family, there is a possibility of reduction in misunderstandings amongst each other.
    <h4>4. A limited number of children</h4>
    
    In nuclear families, the family planning programme is successful.
    Nuclear family members have to prepare and restrain their families as they have to bear all the duties and costs of rearing their children themselves.
    <h4>5. Women’s Good Status:</h4>
    
    Women get sufficient time to take care of their kids.
    Women also get time, corresponding to their own idea, to organize and maintain her home. No pressure from the elders.
    Disadvantages of the nuclear family
    <h4>1. Insecurity feel for widows, and at old age</h4>
    
    In a nuclear family widowed, or old people will feel insecure since they won’t have emotional or financial support.
    With old age, the health will fail, in nuclear family old age people may not find the support for their sustenance.
    <h4>2. An economic drawback</h4>
    
    As they live separately, the family property is split among the siblings, so the land is subdivided, causing economic loss.
    <h4>3. Children’s insecurity</h4>
    
    Both husband and wife pursue careers hence children may feel neglected.
    They may feel isolated and anxious emotionally.
    There is a possiblity of children growing in the wrong path, as working parents would be busy and may not spend sufficient time with their children.
    As individuals do not get a chance to interact with other family members, they may become unsocial.
    <h4>5. Loneliness</h4>
    
    The sense of loneliness is one of the big disadvantages of the nuclear family.
